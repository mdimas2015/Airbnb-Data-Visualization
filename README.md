# Airbnb-Data-Visualization
Project 2



  Listing a home on AirBnb in Los Angeles can be daunting for some considering how competitive the market can get. Thankfully by utilizing Javascript, Plotly, HTML and others, we can create a handy research tool. 
  
 Our goal was to help our teammate Joshua, who is involved in the real estate business, to create a web page displaying AirBnB Prices and other info for Los Angeles. The front page is designed for hosts thinking about listing their home on AirBnB but need guidance on things like price or even description. 

  We were able to find a dataset on Kaggle that had all the AirBnB data for Los Angeles in a CSV. We then used Plotlyâ€™s bundled graphs to help create the interactive visualizations. We also created a live map that can filter based on zip code and other criteria.
